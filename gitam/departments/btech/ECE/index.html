                      Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) was established in the year 2009.
It conducts a B.Tech program in ECE and M.Tech program in VLSI and Embedded System Design.
The Department has several well -equipped laboratories, namely, Microwave and Optical Communication, Digital Communications, Electronic Computer Aided Design and VLSI, Digital Signal Processing, Microprocessors and Microcomputers, IC Applications, Analog Communications, ,Analog Electronic Circuits, , Electronic Circuit Analysis, Electronic Devices and Circuits, Simulation using MATLAB.
Faculty members are accomplished doctorates and postgraduates with diverse specializations. Faculty development programmes are conducted regularly to keep abreast with the technology. Interactions with Industry are done in the form of informal interactions and workshops. Students are encouraged to take up industry related projects in house.
Various events are conducted to make the students excel in extra and curricular activities. Many of our students have excelled in national and multinational companies. Also large number of students who opted for higher studies abroad has emerged out with flying colors.

                        The field of Digital Signal Processing was developed due to the flexibility offered by the use of digital computers in implementing signal processing algorithms and systems. The goal of DSP is usually to measure, filter and/or compress continuous real-world analog signals. But to deal with real life analog signals from our environment, it is necessary to convert them to digital form, and vice-versa. This lab boasts of plenty of powerful computers preinstalled with MATLAB and Code Composer Studio (CCStudio), and high-speed Digital Signal Processors of the TMS320C6713 Digital Starter Kit (DSK) family by Texas Instruments.
                         Using these, students are able to perform real-time analysis of signals and get hands-on experience about the theory they have learned in the class.
